# Hardware Overview
## Purpose

The hardware layer forms the physical and virtual foundation of the homelab.
It defines the tangible computing resources that power Kubernetes workloads, host services, and enable secure network communication across environments.

### This layer provides:
* Scalability through modular nodes and replaceable components
* Reliability via redundant power and network paths

Separation of Concerns between orchestration, workloads, and management systems

Upgrade Flexibility to adapt as requirements grow

## Core Categories
### 1. Raspberry Pi Cluster

The backbone of the homelabâ€™s Kubernetes environment.

| Role | Model |	RAM |	Purpose |	Notes
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control Plane	Raspberry Pi | 4 B |	8 GB |	Hosts k3s server and core control plane services| Boots from external SSD for reliability
| Worker Node #1	Raspberry Pi |4 B|	8 GB |Handles application pods and offloaded workloads |	Same configuration as control plane
|Ansible Node Raspberry Pi | 4 | 4 GB |	Dedicated for automation, provisioning, and management tasks |	Planned to use SSD as OS drive

The Raspberry Pi cluster provides a power-efficient and fully self-contained Kubernetes environment for testing and production services.

### 2. Mini-PC Nodes
Small-form-factor systems providing additional compute power for heavier workloads.
* **Manager PC** â€” Hosts game servers (Minecraft and Factorio), GitHub repos, and management scripts.
	* [Nucbox](https://www.amazon.com/GMKtec-G5-Business-Computer-Ethernet/dp/B0FQT44ZCJ/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)
* **Planned Upgrade** â€” A new mini PC to assume control-plane duties for production services, offloading the Raspberry Pis to be dedicated workers. 
	* Most likely a Mini PC with Ryzen 5825U, 6800H, or higher
	* Better for vertical scaling apps like game servers such as Minecraft or Factorio 

This separation improves reliability, resource allocation, and makes upgrading or rebooting less disruptive.

### 3. Virtual Infrastructure (VPS)

Although not *physically owned*, the **Hetzner VPS** serves as a crucial hardware-equivalent component â€” the **public edge** of the homelab.

* **Purpose**: Acts as the hub in the WireGuard overlay network
* **Functions**: Public ingress, reverse proxy routing, and secured tunnel endpoint
* **Location**: Remote Datacenter (Hetzner Cloud)
* **Benefits**: Provides static public IP without exposing home network

Treat this as *virtual hardware*: it behaves like a remote physical node but is rented compute capacity rather than owned silicon.

### 4. Personal and Development Systems
* **Devhost Workstation**: Used for local development, VS Code Remote sessions, and cluster orchestration.
* **Laptop**: Used for remote work and access to services (e.g., Wiki.js UI and SSH sessions).
These systems serve as interface nodes between the homelab infrastructure and end-user environments.

> ðŸ”— See [Development Workstation](./hardware/workstation)

### 5. Networking and Power Infrastructure

#### Supporting devices that tie everything together:
* Router: Asus Router (central LAN gateway)
* Switches: Managed Gigabit Switches for cluster and mini PC interconnectivity
* Cabling: Cat 6 Ethernet runs throughout for stability and speed
* Power Management: Surge-protected power strips and organized cable layout

#### MoCA Adapters (Deprecated Experiment)
Previously tested for bridging Ethernet over coax, but deprecated due to:

* Interference and signal degradation over long coax runs
* Inconsistent throughput compared to direct Ethernet
* Complexity in troubleshooting and routing loops

> ðŸ”— See [MoCA Adapters](/public/infrastructure/hardware/moca)
## Future Upgrades
### Planned Upgrade	Purpose
* **New Mini PC Server**	Serve as primary control plane for heavier workloads and container hosting
* **Dedicated NAS**	Centralized storage for backups and persistent volumes
* **SSD Reassignment**	Either reused for Ansible OS or remain with Pi control plane

## Summary

The homelab hardware layer integrates local compute, virtual infrastructure, and network support devices into a cohesive, modular system.
It provides a foundation that is scalable, secure, and adaptable, ready to expand as new nodes, NAS storage, or dedicated services come online.

Each physical or virtual node serves a distinct role but contributes to a unified ecosystem focused on performance, isolation, and reproducibility.
