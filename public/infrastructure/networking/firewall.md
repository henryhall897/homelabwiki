# Firewall
## Purpose

The firewall layer is a critical security boundary within the homelab network. It enforces where, how, and from whom traffic can flow ‚Äî ensuring that all ingress originates through the VPS Gateway and WireGuard VPN, and that no service is ever exposed directly over the public internet.

## Firewalls work hand-in-hand with the VPN and VPS to:
* Force all public ingress through the secure WireGuard tunnel
* Prevent external systems from reaching private infrastructure directly
* Control inter-node (east-west) communication within the cluster
* Maintain a clear separation between public, private, and management networks

## Design Overview

### All network paths follow a ‚ÄúVPN-first‚Äù policy:
no traffic enters the homelab from the public internet without first traversing the WireGuard-encrypted channel that connects the VPS and home servers.

### Key Enforcement Layers
1. #### VPS Gateway Firewall (Cloud Level)
* Accepts public HTTPS and VPN (WireGuard) connections only
* Drops any attempt to reach internal IPs or ports directly
* Forwards authenticated WireGuard traffic into the private tunnel
* Routes requests to internal services only when explicitly defined
2. #### Home Server Firewall (Edge Level)
* Accepts inbound connections only from the VPS‚Äôs WireGuard IP
* Rejects or drops all other public inbound requests
* Ensures public-facing services (e.g., wiki, API, dashboards) are accessible only via the VPN path
3. #### Cluster-Level Policies (Internal Level)
* Kubernetes NetworkPolicies define pod-to-pod (east-west) traffic rules
* UFW and nftables reinforce these controls on the host OS
* Namespaces are isolated so a breach in one workload cannot laterally move through the cluster
### Interaction with VPN and VPS
#### The VPN and firewall layers operate together as a single access funnel:
* The VPS Gateway exposes only the WireGuard port and public service endpoints.
* The WireGuard Tunnel carries encrypted packets into the homelab network.
* The Home Firewall validates that the source is the VPS peer and only then permits forwarding to internal hosts.
* If a route is not explicitly configured or a peer not allowed, packets simply die at the VPS ‚Äî never reaching the internal network.
#### This architecture ensures:
* No direct exposure of the residential IP or LAN devices
* Complete ingress control via VPN routing policies
* Granular path definition (traffic must match an allowed route)

#### Tools and Configuration
* The firewall layer relies on several tools across different layers:
* UFW for simple interface-level rules (default deny, allow from VPS subnet only)
* nftables for fine-grained packet filtering and NAT handling
* Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for namespace-level isolation
* Fail2Ban and rate limiting for brute-force and flood protection on public services

## Example:

### Allow traffic only from VPS WireGuard IP
```bash
ufw allow from 10.100.0.1 to any port 443 proto tcp
ufw deny in from any to any
```
## Security Practices
* Public ingress is only through the VPS ‚Üí WireGuard ‚Üí Homelab path
* SSH and admin ports restricted to specific WireGuard peers
* Default-deny policy at every layer (cloud, OS, and cluster)
* Planned automation of firewall and routing rules through Ansible for consistent policy management

## Summary

The firewall layer enforces the principle that if it‚Äôs not through the VPN, it doesn‚Äôt exist.
It acts as both a shield and a gatekeeper ‚Äî ensuring all inbound traffic comes through approved, encrypted channels and that even internal communications remain strictly controlled.

Together, the VPS Gateway, WireGuard VPN, and firewall stack create a defense-in-depth perimeter that isolates, encrypts, and audits every connection to the homelab.
