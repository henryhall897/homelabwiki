# DNS and Domains

## Purpose

The **DNS and domain layer** provides the public-facing identity of the homelab and handles name resolution for both external and internal services.

By using a single domain name and strategically defined subdomains, all homelab services can be accessed in a **unified**, **human-readable way** â€” whether they are hosted locally, in the cloud, or inside the **Kubernetes cluster**.

## Domain Providers

**Domains** can be registered and managed through various providers, each offering different pricing, reliability, and integration options.
### Common examples include:
#### Cloudflare:	
**Features**:
* Free DNS 
* Global CDN
* DDoS protection 
* SSL/TLS management
* Workers
* R2 storage

**Summary**:
Excellent for technical users. Integrates well with Kubernetes ingress, Traefik, and self-hosted services.
#### Google Domains (now under Squarespace)	
**Features**: 
* Simple management
* easy Gmail/Workspace integration	

**Summary**:
* Less flexible for advanced configurations.
#### Namecheap
**Features**:
* Affordable 
* straightforward UI
* good support	

**Summary**:
* Great for basic DNS setups.
#### Porkbun	
**Features** 
* Budget-friendly
* free WHOIS privacy	Reliable for simple domain ownership.

**Summary**:
Solid choice especially on a budget
#### AWS Route 53	
**Features**:
* Scalable
* API-driven 
* DNS with health checks
* private hosted zones	

**Summary**:
* Enterprise-grade but more complex.
## Why I Chose Cloudflare

### I use Cloudflare as my domain registrar and DNS provider because:
* Itâ€™s a trusted, security-focused company with one of the largest global DNS networks.
* It provides free DNS hosting with low latency and built-in protection against common network attacks.
* It integrates tightly with modern web stacks â€” including support for CNAME flattening, custom records, and easy API automation.
* It offers additional services I may use in the future, such as Cloudflare R2 (object storage), Zero Trust tunnels, and page rules for traffic management.
* Cloudflare also has an outstanding record of defending against DDoS attacks and large-scale outages, making it a robust choice for homelab DNS.

## Subdomains and Unified Access
A single registered domain can host multiple services using subdomains, allowing consistent and organized access:

### Examples in homelab
#### Factorio	
**factorio.henryhalldev.com** - Public Factorio server proxied through VPS
#### Minecraft	
**mc.henryhalldev.com** - Dockerized Minecraft instance
#### Wiki.js	
[wiki.henryhalldev.com](https://wiki.henryhalldev.com) - 	Knowledge base and documentation

This structure scales naturally as new applications are added to the homelab, and it keeps service URLs readable and consistent.

## HTTPS and Proxying

Cloudflare supports SSL/TLS termination and proxying (orange cloud mode), but this depends on where the service terminates HTTPS:

### Full (Strict) mode: 
Can secure traffic end-to-end when your VPS or Traefik ingress provides a valid certificate (e.g., via Letâ€™s Encrypt).

### Proxying (orange cloud): 
Can hide your VPSâ€™s public IP, route requests through Cloudflareâ€™s network, and offer caching and DDoS protection.

### DNS-only (gray cloud): 
Simply resolves DNS and passes traffic directly to the VPS â€” this is often required for custom TCP/UDP services (like Factorio or Minecraft), since Cloudflare canâ€™t proxy those ports.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to proxy Factorioâ€™s raw game traffic through Cloudflare, but other web services can proxy HTTPS services through Cloudflare with SSL and caching enabled.

## Private DNS
For internal name resolution, private DNS handles traffic within the homelab network:

### Internal hostnames: 
such as **devhost.local** or **k3s-master.local**

### Cluster service domains 
like **postgres.default.svc.cluster.local**

### Optional integration with CoreDNS or systemd-resolved for local routing rules

Private DNS ensures that local nodes and containers communicate using private IPs over WireGuard, without exposing internal networks to the public internet.

## Summary

Cloudflare provides **DNS management**, **HTTPS proxying**, and a suite of security tools ideal for homelab use.

**One domain** is enough for **all public services**, thanks to subdomains that map to different apps or nodes.

HTTPS proxying is supported for web services but not for custom TCP/UDP game ports.

Private DNS resolves internal services within the WireGuard network and Kubernetes cluster.
