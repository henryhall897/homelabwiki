# Ubuntu Server Configuration Overview
## Purpose

[Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (64-bit)](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) is the primary operating system powering all Raspberry Pi and Mini-PC nodes in the homelab.
It provides a stable, secure, and lightweight base ideal for Kubernetes (K3s), Docker, and automated provisioning via Ansible.

The focus is on **long-term reliability, security hardening, and minimal overhead** â€” ensuring each node runs efficiently and consistently within the cluster.

## 1. Rationale for Choosing Ubuntu Server
### Proven Stability

Ubuntuâ€™s LTS (Long-Term Support) releases offer five years of security updates and kernel support, making it well-suited for persistent, unattended systems.

### Wide Ecosystem

Ubuntuâ€™s compatibility with cloud, container, and DevOps tooling (Docker, K3s, Ansible, Helm, Trivy, etc.) ensures seamless integration with modern infrastructure.

### Active Community

Extensive documentation, tutorials, and an active community make Ubuntu one of the most accessible platforms for maintenance and troubleshooting.

## 2. Installation and Base Configuration
Each node is installed with a minimal image to reduce resource usage and attack surface.

### Initial Setup Checklist
* Select Minimal Installation (no desktop environment)
* Create a non-root user with sudo privileges
* Enable OpenSSH for remote access
* Configure static IP or WireGuard tunnel
* Disable password authentication (SSH keys only)
* Apply automatic security updates
* Install core tooling: curl, git, ufw, fail2ban, htop, etc.

## 3. Security and Hardening Practices

Ubuntu nodes follow a least-privilege and defense-in-depth model to comply with cluster-wide security baselines.

### Core Configuration Principles
* Non-root operation â€” Applications run under limited users or service accounts
* UFW firewall â€” Default deny inbound, allow required ports only
* SSH hardening â€” Key-based login only, root login disabled
* Kernel hardening â€” Apply sysctl and seccomp restrictions
* Automated upgrades â€” Unattended package and security patching

## 4. Integration with Cluster and Automation

All nodes are configured for Ansible-based provisioning, allowing updates, package installs, and configuration changes to propagate automatically.

Ubuntuâ€™s consistent package management and service control (systemd) make it ideal for automation across heterogeneous hardware such as Raspberry Pis and x86 mini-PCs.

## 5. Maintenance and Lifecycle
* **Patch cadence**: Weekly automatic security updates
* **Manual upgrades**: Major version bumps every 2â€“3 years (LTS-to-LTS)
* **Monitoring**: Logs via journalctl, system metrics via K3s/Prometheus
* **Recovery**: Nodes can be reimaged and rejoined via automated bootstrap scripts

## Summary

Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS provides a robust, predictable, and secure base layer for the homelabâ€™s Kubernetes and container infrastructure.
Its combination of community support, strong security defaults, and ecosystem compatibility makes it the ideal choice for a long-term, maintainable cluster foundation.
